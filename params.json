You only provide it a\r\npcap-file and are rewarded a structured export of all files found in it.\r\n_pcacpfex_ allows data extraction even if non-standard protocols were used. \r\nIt's easy to understand plugin-system offers python developers a quick way \r\nto add more file-types, encodings or\r\neven complex protocols.\r\n\r\n### Requirements\r\n_pcapfex_ was developed and tested for **Linux environments only**.\r\nDue to missing optimizations and tests, there is no guarantee for it to work\r\nunder Windows (though it should work).\r\n\r\n_pcapfex_ depends on **Python 2.7** and the **_dpkt_** package. You can install \r\nit via\r\n```\r\nsudo pip install dpkt\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Usage\r\nTo analyze a pcap-file ```samplefile.pcap``` just use\r\n```\r\npcapfex.py samplefile.pcap\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nFor more detailed usage information see\r\n```\r\npcapfex.py -h\r\n```\r\n\r\nPlease make sure to use the ```-nv``` flag, if the machine\r\nthat captured the traffic was sending data as well. This will\r\ncircumvent wrong checksums stored in the pcap-file caused by\r\nTCP-Checksum-Offloading.\r\n\r\n### License\r\n_pcapfex_ is published under the Apache 2.0 license.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
